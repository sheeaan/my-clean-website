my personal corner of the internet.

## why this exists

i got tired of looking at generic portfolio templates and thought "i can do better than this." so after procrastinating for way too long, i finally sat down and built something i actually like.

it's part portfolio, part personal brand, part project archive - basically a place where i can point people to when they ask "so what do you do?"

## what's in here

- **about** - quick intro, what i'm working on, what i'm exploring
- **projects** - stuff i've built, with some fun scroll animations
- **experience** - work history and such
- **photos** - because life isn't just code

## built with

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion

## running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

then open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## notes

built in about a week. there might be a few easter eggs hidden around if you look closely.

developed with assistance from Claude (AI) - we make a good team.
