my personal part of the internet.

## why this exists

i lowkey felt like I was missing out after seeing all of my friends building upon their personal website so after procrastinating for way too long, i finally sat down and built something i actually like. i actually think having your own part of the internet to show who you are and the share the things you like to do is a great way to put yourself out there. 

it's part portfolio, part personal brand, part project archive - basically a place where i can point people to when they ask "so what do you do?"

## what's in here

- **about** - quick intro, what i'm working on, what i'm exploring

- **photos** - because life isn't just code
